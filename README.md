# Educational Technology Plan

Santos Reyes Educational Technology Plan for Computer Science Principles (CSP). 

## Context

### Course
*Computer Science Principles*

Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the
world. More than a traditional introduction to programming Computer Science Principes. High school students does not require prerequisite skills for the curriculum on 
code.org. 

Computer Science Principles will focus on High School students in grades 10-12. 

### Situation

Currently our school does not offer Computer Science courses. Initially the CSP course would be an elective and build toward a Career Tecnical Education Pathway. The CTE 
pathway requires additional credentialling. Our District provides Hewlett-Pachard (HP) Chromebooks to Middle School and High School students. Student computers 
are updated at the beginning of their sophmore year. I don't imagine a homogonous set of student chromebooks.

English Language Learners, Special Education, and female students will be recruited. Support for students can be provided from a Paraprofessional and/or Teacher. I currently 
teach in a collaboration setting and I have worked with Paraprofessionals.

## Plan

### Software Specificationss

Starting a new course, in my district, will require starting with the bare minimimum. Code.org and codehs.com offer resource and Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE). Aries Gradebook, Google Classroom, codehs.com, Code.org or Classroom Relay will be used as learning managment system. I use Kahoot, PearDeck, Kami, Google 
workspace, a projector, document camera, and smart board (Active Inspire) for lesson delivery and engagment. I soon will have an 80" 
smartTV in the classroom. 

Teacher Computer:
Device: HP Laptop
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-8365U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.90 GHz
Intalled RAM: 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable)
System type: 64-bit operating systm, x64-based processor

Student Computer: 
Device: Dell Chromebook
Processor: Intel(R) Celeron(R) N4020 CPU @ 1.10Ghz
Intalled RAM: 4 GB
System type:

### Hardware Specifications
There is one ethernet connection in my classroom. Students connect via wifi. There has been connectivity issues prior to Distance Learning. This year internet issues have been 
mostly district wide. The resources I plan to use are accessible or an email to IT can resolve an issue quickly. 

From Code.org:
We recommend at least a 15 MBit/sec Internet connection for your school.
The smallest screen size we support is 1024 x 728 px.
You will need a desktop or laptop computer with a mouse (or touchpad) and
keyboard for our middle and high school-level courses: CS Discoveries, CS 
Principles, and Intro to App Lab. Most tablets and mobile devices are not 
supported for these courses. See "Mobile and Tablet Support Details" below for 
device-specific exceptions.

### Application

I can create classes on code.org where students can use the IDE to write, run, and submit coding assignments. I can give feedback to student work through created classes or 
submit through Google Classroom and use Kami for grading and feedback. Giving students an outline of assignments to keep the same formatting and keeping to the coherance 
principle. Many of my Autistic students need minimization and keep to the plan. Provide opportunities for Peer Instruction for multiple opportunities for discussion and to 
revise their approach after hearing others out. I can help them share their screens through Classroom Relay. Pair programming can benefit students who are struggling or not a
confident yet.


### Impacts

Fostering a creative open safe learning environment where students can grow. Structure allowing for creativity. 

English Language Learners, Special Education, and female students will be recruited. Support for students can be provided from a Paraprofessional and/or Teacher. I currently 
teach in a collaboration setting and I have worked with Paraprofessionals. Fostering a safe equitable environment that bases grades on creative solutions to tasks. Encouraging 
all students regardless of gender or background to perservere through challenges. As the lead I will need to change how I address my students without using gender and create 
the opportunity for inclusivity. One advantage to using web based resources is it lends itself to distance learning.
