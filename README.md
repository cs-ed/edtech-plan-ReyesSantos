# Educational Technology Plan

Santos Reyes Educational Technology Plan for Computer Science Principles (CSP). 

## Context

### Course
### Computer Science Principles

Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the
world. More than a traditional introduction to programming Computer Science Principes for high school students does not require prerequisite skills utilizing the curriculum on 
code.org. 

Computer Science Principles will focus on High School students in grades 10-12. 

### Situation

Currently our schools does not offer any Computer Science courses. In the Middle Schools and High Schools students are issued Hewlett-Packard Chromebooks. Student computers 
are updated at the beginning of their 10 grade school year. 

The course will have a mixture of individual and group collaboration assignments. English Language Learners, Special Education, and female students will be supported in a
Teacher collaboration classroom setting. Currently the maximum of 38 students for each class. 

## Plan

### Software Specificationss

Starting a new course will require starting with the bare minimimum. Code.org and KhanAcademy.com offers curriculum lessons for free. Aries Gradebook and Google Classroom will 
be used for learning managment system. 

Teacher Computer:
Device: HP Laptop
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-8365U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.90 GHz
Intalled RAM: 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable)
System type: 64-bit operating systm, x64-based processor

System type:

### Hardware Specifications

From Code.org:
We recommend at least a 15 MBit/sec Internet connection for your school.
The smallest screen size we support is 1024 x 728 px.
You will need a desktop or laptop computer with a mouse (or touchpad) and
keyboard for our middle and high school-level courses: CS Discoveries, CS 
Principles, and Intro to App Lab. Most tablets and mobile devices are not 
supported for these courses. See "Mobile and Tablet Support Details" below for 
device-specific exceptions.

### Application

Problets, Labs, and/or projects. Based on our deomogrpahics assignments would be limited to inclass. Lessons with increasing the level 
of difficulty as the basics are developed.



### Impacts

Fostering a safe equitable environment that bases grades on creative solutions to tasks. Encouraging all students regardless of gender 
or background to perservere through challenges. As the lead I will need to change how I address my students without using gender.
